Why use TypeScript? (umbrella pics)

- because of feelings. "Feelings"
- WTF Feelings bro?
- because it feels bad to have bugs
- (inverse umbrella pic)
- and it feels great to have someone taking care of you
- (girls umbrella pic)... having your back
- It feels great to get into the FLOW state.
- - To be at the top of your productivity. To do your best.
